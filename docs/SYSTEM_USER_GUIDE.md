Welcome to the comprehensive User Guide for the Community Modules platform.

---

## 1. Your Personal Website

Every registered user is provisioned a personal subspace (e.g., `/john-doe/home`) using the `user_websites` module. You can use the standard Odoo website builder to drag and drop widgets, structure layouts, and write text safely without affecting the root domain.

---

## 2. Managing Your Profile & Privacy Settings

All user preferences are centralized in your Account Settings (`/my/home`).
* **Privacy & Security:** By default, your website is unlisted. You can opt-in to display your website in the public `/community` directory.
* **Data Erasure:** Under the `/my/privacy` route, you can instantly export all of your generated content or exercise your Right to Erasure to securely wipe your sub-sites from the platform.

## 3. Shared Group Sites

Users can collaborate by creating a "Website Group". Group sites function exactly like personal sites, but ownership is securely delegated to an auto-generated Odoo security group, allowing multiple members to edit pages and author blog posts under a common shared banner.

---

## 4. Community Moderation

The platform includes a built-in moderation engine. Any user or guest can flag a personal website or blog post via the "Report Violation" button. These reports are strictly shielded from the content owner to prevent retaliation and trigger an automated "Three-Strikes" suspension policy administered by platform administrators.
