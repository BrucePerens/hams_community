# Manual Library (`manual_library`)

*Copyright © Bruce Perens K6BP. Licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0).*

This Odoo module provides a clean-room, open-source implementation of a hierarchical documentation and knowledge-base system for Odoo Community. 

It is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the proprietary Odoo Enterprise `knowledge` module, allowing other community modules to install and manage documentation via standard Odoo XML data loading without requiring an Enterprise license.

**Open Source Isolation Mandate:** This module is Open Source and available to the Odoo Community. It MUST NEVER be given dependencies on `ham_*` modules or anything else from the proprietary codebase.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Hierarchical Documentation:** Organize articles in a nested tree structure (parent/child relationships) for easy navigation.
* **API Interoperability:** Implements the core `knowledge.article` model and fields, ensuring compatibility with standard XML data files generated by other modules.
* **Rich Text Editing:** Utilizes Odoo's standard HTML editor for robust content creation.
* **Public Knowledge Base:** Published articles are accessible on the frontend website, complete with a dynamically generated sidebar for hierarchical navigation.
* **Granular Access Control:** Three distinct access tiers (Admin, Internal User, Public Guest) ensure sensitive internal documentation remains secure while allowing public guides to be freely accessible.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Copy the `manual_library` directory into your active Odoo `addons` path.
2. Restart your Odoo server service.
3. Log in to Odoo as an Administrator with Developer Mode enabled.
4. Navigate to **Apps**, click **Update Apps List**, and remove the default "Apps" filter.
5. Search for `Manual Library` and click **Activate** / **Install**.

## 📖 Usage

### Managing Articles (Backend)
1. Navigate to the **Manuals** app in the main Odoo menu.
2. Click **New** to create an article.
3. Use the **Parent Article** field to nest the article under an existing topic.
4. Toggle the **Is Published** smart button to make the article visible on the public website.

### Viewing Articles (Frontend)
* Navigate to `/manual` on your Odoo website to view the public knowledge base.
* The frontend features a WCAG-compliant navigation sidebar that automatically builds itself based on the published article hierarchy.

## ⚖️ Legal & Architectural Note

This project is an independent, clean-room implementation. It was built strictly according to the Abstraction-Filtration-Comparison test (*Computer Associates v. Altai*) and the API Interoperability precedent (*Google v. Oracle*). It does not contain any literal or non-literal copied code, logic, or proprietary UI designs from Odoo Enterprise. The internal security model, backend views, and frontend routing are 100% original community implementations.
