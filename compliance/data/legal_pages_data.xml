                            <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our community services and user websites.</p>
                            
                            <h3 class="mt-4">2. Data We Collect</h3>
                            <p>We believe in Data Minimization. We only collect what is strictly necessary to operate the platform:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Your name, email address, and login credentials when you register.</li>
                                <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> Any blog posts, website pages, or comments you explicitly choose to publish.</li>
                                <li><strong>System Interactions:</strong> Essential technical data such as standard web server logs necessary for security and abuse prevention.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><em>Note: Our platform utilizes privacy-friendly view counters that aggregate page hits without tracking individual IP addresses or relying on invasive marketing cookies.</em></p>

                            <h3 class="mt-4">3. How We Use Your Data</h3>
                            <p>We use your data exclusively to provide the services you request, such as rendering your personal website, delivering email digests to which you have explicitly subscribed, and moderating community safety.</p>
                            <p><strong>We do not sell your personal data to third parties.</strong></p>

                            <h3 class="mt-4">4. Your Regulatory Rights (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)</h3>
                            <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you have robust rights regarding your personal data. We have built facilities directly into your user dashboard to exercise these rights immediately:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> You may download a machine-readable JSON copy of all your authored content via the <code>/my/privacy</code> dashboard.</li>
                                <li><strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> You may permanently and instantly delete all your personal content and remove yourself from our directories via the <code>/my/privacy</code> dashboard.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 class="mt-4">5. Community Safety &amp; Reporting</h3>
                            <p>To ensure a safe environment, we operate an abuse reporting system. If you report content, your identity and email address are shielded strictly from the content owner to prevent retaliation, and are visible only to platform administrators.</p>

                            <h3 class="mt-4">1. What Are Cookies?</h3>
                            <p>Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work efficiently and provide a better user experience.</p>

                            <h3 class="mt-4">2. How We Use Cookies</h3>
                            <p>Our platform uses Odoo's native architecture, which prioritizes user privacy. We categorize cookies into two types:</p>
                            
                            <h4 class="mt-3">Essential Cookies (Strictly Necessary)</h4>
                            <p>These cookies are required for the website to function securely and cannot be switched off. They include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Session cookies that keep you securely logged in.</li>
                                <li>CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens that protect forms and reports from malicious attacks.</li>
                                <li>Consent memory cookies that remember whether you accepted or declined optional cookies.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4 class="mt-3">Optional Cookies (Analytics &amp; Third-Party)</h4>
                            <p>We do not load third-party tracking scripts or marketing cookies by default. If optional features are added in the future, our built-in Consent Manager will actively block them until you explicitly click "Accept" on the cookie banner.</p>

                            <h3 class="mt-4">3. Managing Your Preferences</h3>
                            <p>You can manage or withdraw your consent for optional cookies at any time by interacting with the Cookie Consent Manager visible on our website, or by clearing the cookies in your browser settings.</p>

                                <li><strong>Three-Strike System:</strong> Verified violations will result in a strike against your account. Accumulating three (3) strikes results in an automatic suspension, immediately unpublishing all of your content.</li>
